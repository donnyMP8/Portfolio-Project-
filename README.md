# Portfolio-Project-
This portfolio is a reflection of who I am, my attributes, and what makes me unique.
It tells the story of my journey into software engineering and software development, a path inspired by my older brothers and mentors who motivated me to pursue this field.

I built this project using only HTML and CSS for the design. It showcases the resources and knowledge I gathered from:
The labs I completed on Canvas
youtube videos are helpfull to keep your mind open for beautifull design and you can add your own touch 
My research on W3Schools and HTML Cheat Sheets
Valuable tips and modifications from my older brothers/mentors
