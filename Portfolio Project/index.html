          <p>
            I have spent a significant part of my life in diffrent places,
            fluent in many languages and finished in an french school, current
            in Nairobi. I am a 20-year-old man with a strong passion for
            science, specializing in Biology, and I’m also deeply interested in
            sports and the way the human body works.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I am an active athlete in Nairobi. I play basketball,
            rugby, and do sprinting, alongside being a gym enthusiast and coach.
            Outside of sports, I enjoy connecting with people, going out with
            friends, shopping, and partying on Fridays.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also have a musical career that has spanned about six years,
            singing professionally in churches, events, auditions, and weddings.
            Most notably, I sing as a Tenor in the Catholic church choir at St.
            Austin’s with the CCFN group.

      <p>
        I am a 20-year-old with a school diploma in Biochemistry and a strong
        passion for science, particularly Biology and Biotechnology. My academic
        background has provided me with a solid foundation in understanding the
        human body, chemistry, and life sciences, which I plan to expand further
        through advanced studies in Biotechnology.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am eager to learn programming because I see it as a powerful tool that
        enhances scientific research and innovation. By integrating
        Biotechnology with programming, I aim to contribute to solving
        real-world challenges in healthcare, sports science, and bioinformatics,
        while developing innovative solutions that can make a meaningful impact
        on society.
